it think next thing to do is the boundry matrix function to compute betti numbers.
we used oriented scx in lectures but I think it would work with nonoriented scx
also and would be much easier to do, since im not sure how we would orient
these cubical scx. also the cubical_complex function works well, so I
think the problem you were having is when constructing the grid for the shapes.

also sorry for the weird mix of sets and lists but if you agree that we do
nonoriented i think its much easier with sets.
